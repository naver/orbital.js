This package generates plugin resource files for a static web project
which could be served by any web servers.
Not all the projects require the feature of dynamic installation of plugins,
so this command generates plugin resources with just start and stop functionality
without dynamic installation. This feature could help developers who just want
use plugin based developing with their service which does not require
dynamic installation.
